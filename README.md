    Based on the accuracy (ACC) of the different models evaluated, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. Random Forest Classifier (RFC): Achieved the highest accuracy at 99.75%. This indicates that RFC is the best performing model among those evaluated.


2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Achieved the second highest accuracy at 98.34%, suggesting it is also a strong performer.


3. Decision Tree Classifier (DTC): With an accuracy of 97.91%, DTC is another effective model, closely following KNN.


4. Support Vector Classifier (SVC): Achieved 95.20% accuracy, which is decent but lower than RFC, KNN, and DTC.


5. Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC): Achieved 93.85% accuracy, showing good performance but not as high as the top models.


6. Logistic Regression (LR): With the lowest accuracy at 83.45%, this model is the least effective among the ones evaluated.


Conclusion:

    The Random Forest Classifier (RFC) is the best model for this task, providing the highest accuracy. If interpretability is a key concern, models like Decision Tree Classifier (DTC) might still be useful despite slightly lower accuracy. However, RFC is recommended for its superior performance.
